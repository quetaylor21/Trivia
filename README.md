## Getting Started
I started this Application with "Create React App" for the boilerplate. 

To get the app up and runing you can run these commands from your terminal

make a new directory for the project
git clone git@github.com:quetaylor21/Trivia.git
cd Trivia
npm install
npm start

the app will be running on localhost:3000
